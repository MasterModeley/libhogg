## libhogg

---

libhogg is a C++ library for extracting information from the hogg archive used by games developed by Cryptic Studios (built and tested on Neverwinter, but I think the Star Trek Online format is the same).

*This software DOES NOT modify the game or the data used by the game in any way.  It is intended for educational use only.*

### Usage

Most of what you probably want to accomplish can be done by using the 'hogg' utility included in tools/hogg -- this is a command line program that can extract files from the archive, list all files contained in the archive, or print information about the files contained in the archive.
